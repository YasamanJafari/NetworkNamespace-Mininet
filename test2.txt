                     Based on research done at Tektronix

PHYSIOLOGICAL GUIDELINES:

        Avoid simultaneous display of  highly  saturated,  spectrally  extreme 
colors.  Reds, oranges, yellows,  and greens can be viewed without refocusing, 
but  cyan  and  blues  cannot be easily viewed at the same time at as red.  To 
avoid frequent refocusing and visual fatigue,  extreme color pairs such as red 
and  blue  or  yellow  and  purple  should  avoided.   However,   desaturating 
spectrally extreme colors will reduce the need for refocusing.
